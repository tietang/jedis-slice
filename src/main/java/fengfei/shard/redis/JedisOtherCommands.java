     * BLPOP (and BRPOP) is a blocking list pop primitive. You can see this
     * commands as blocking versions of LPOP and RPOP able to block if the
     * specified keys don't exist or contain empty lists.
     * <p>
     * The following is a description of the exact semantic. We describe BLPOP
     * but the two commands are identical, the only difference is that BLPOP
     * pops the element from the left (head) of the list, and BRPOP pops from
     * the right (tail).
     * <p>
     * <b>Non blocking behavior</b>
     * <p>
     * When BLPOP is called, if at least one of the specified keys contain a non
     * empty list, an element is popped from the head of the list and returned
     * to the caller together with the name of the key (BLPOP returns a two
     * elements array, the first element is the key, the second the popped
     * value).
     * <p>
     * Keys are scanned from left to right, so for instance if you issue BLPOP
     * list1 list2 list3 0 against a dataset where list1 does not exist but
     * list2 and list3 contain non empty lists, BLPOP guarantees to return an
     * element from the list stored at list2 (since it is the first non empty
     * list starting from the left).
     * <p>
     * <b>Blocking behavior</b>
     * <p>
     * If none of the specified keys exist or contain non empty lists, BLPOP
     * blocks until some other client performs a LPUSH or an RPUSH operation
     * against one of the lists.
     * <p>
     * Once new data is present on one of the lists, the client finally returns
     * with the name of the key unblocking it and the popped value.
     * <p>
     * When blocking, if a non-zero timeout is specified, the client will
     * unblock returning a nil special value if the specified amount of seconds
     * passed without a push operation against at least one of the specified
     * keys.
     * <p>
     * The timeout argument is interpreted as an integer value. A timeout of
     * zero means instead to block forever.
     * <p>
     * <b>Multiple clients blocking for the same keys</b>
     * <p>
     * Multiple clients can block for the same key. They are put into a queue,
     * so the first to be served will be the one that started to wait earlier,
     * in a first-blpopping first-served fashion.
     * <p>
     * <b>blocking POP inside a MULTI/EXEC transaction</b>
     * <p>
     * BLPOP and BRPOP can be used with pipelining (sending multiple commands
     * and reading the replies in batch), but it does not make sense to use
     * BLPOP or BRPOP inside a MULTI/EXEC block (a Redis transaction).
     * <p>
     * The behavior of BLPOP inside MULTI/EXEC when the list is empty is to
     * return a multi-bulk nil reply, exactly what happens when the timeout is
     * reached. If you like science fiction, think at it like if inside

     * configure the server to issue a background saving of the RDB file every
     * 3600 seconds if there are at least 10 changes in the dataset, and every
     * 60 seconds if there are at least 10000 changes. To completely disable
     * automatic snapshots just set the parameter as an empty string.
     * <li>All the integer parameters representing memory are returned and
     * accepted only using bytes as unit.
